/**
 * Single source of truth for product-name strings on the renderer side.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   - The product has been renamed once (Leeadman → Cadence) and may be
 *     renamed again. Hard-coding the string in dozens of components made
 *     the last rename a 27-file change. Importing from here means a
 *     future rename touches one file plus a small list of static assets.
 *   - We need to handle the legacy name in a few places (data migration,
 *     legacy-backup imports, accept-both-names probes). Keeping the
 *     legacy strings beside the new ones keeps that logic honest.
 *
 * What this CAN'T do:
 *   - Static files like `package.json` (read by `electron-builder` and
 *     `npm`), `index.html`, `public/manifest.webmanifest`, `public/icon.svg`
 *     and `README.md` can't import from a TS module. Those have to be
 *     updated in lockstep — search for `APP_NAME` here and grep the repo
 *     for matching string literals.
 *
 * Convention:
 *   - `APP_*` constants — the new (canonical) name.
 *   - `APP_*_LEGACY` constants — the previous name; used ONLY where we
 *     need to recognise old data on disk, accept it from peers, or talk
 *     to it diagnostically.
