# Cadence

**A local-first workspace for the rhythm of your week — people, tasks, notes, goals, feedback, 1:1s, reminders.**

</div>

> **Heads up — this project was previously called *Leeadman*.** It has been fully renamed to **Cadence**: window title, Dock, menus, manifest, on-disk file names (`cadence-data-<userId>.json`, `cadence-accounts.json`, …), localStorage keys and macOS `appId` (`com.cadence.app`) all use the new name. If you have data from a pre-rename build on the same machine, the desktop app **auto-migrates it once on first launch** (it copies `Leeadman/` → `Cadence/`, renaming the `leeadman-*` files to `cadence-*`); the legacy folder is left in place as a safety net. If you only have a JSON backup (`leeadman-backup-*.json` exported from the old build), use *Settings → Backup → Import JSON* — the importer reads the file contents, not the filename.

Cadence is an Electron + React desktop app that helps you run the boring, important parts of your week — 1:1 follow-ups, goal tracking, feedback logs, structured notes for every direct report, and personal to-dos — **without sending any data to a server**. Everything lives on your machine in JSON files under your user folder. No accounts in the cloud, no telemetry.

The same React bundle also deploys to GitHub Pages as a **mobile PWA**, so you can capture quick to-dos from your phone.

## What's in the box

| | |
|---|---|
| **Desktop** | Universal signed + notarized macOS DMG (one file for Apple Silicon **and** Intel), auto-updates via GitHub Releases with an in-app download dialog. Optional PIN lock at launch. |
| **Mobile** | Installable PWA (Add to Home Screen) with a slide-in drawer sidebar, full-screen content, iOS safe-area aware. Offline-capable, optimized for To-dos. |
| **Encrypted on disk** | Workspace data is stored as an **AES-256-GCM** envelope keyed by your account password (Electron). Changing the password rotates the key transparently. |
| **Backups & recovery** | Every save, login and app launch is snapshotted into `backups/<userId>/` (50 rolling slots). A *Settings → Backups & recovery* card lists live + legacy + per-snapshot files with task / people counts and a one-click restore. The writer refuses to overwrite an undecipherable file, so a key mismatch can never silently destroy your data. |
| **AI Assistant (BYO key)** | Every task has an "Ask AI" button when you connect a provider in Settings. Supports **Anthropic Claude**, **OpenAI ChatGPT** and **Google Gemini**; calls go directly from your device to the provider — there's no proxy. Includes a Markdown chat dialog, an "Append answer to task" action and a *To-dos → Extract from notes* tool that turns a brain dump into a structured list of tasks you can drop into any list. |
| **Profile** | Avatar upload, view-only by default with an Edit toggle, in-app **Change password** flow that verifies your current password. |
| **Workspaces** | Multi-team, per-team Me / My-leader workspaces, per-person pages with tasks, goals, notes, **feedback** and documents. |
| **1:1 Mode** | A dedicated meeting view per person with a persistent markdown agenda and an archive of past meetings; unchecked action items carry over. |
| **Person Timeline** | Chronological feed of every item attached to a person, grouped by day, filterable by kind. Killer feature for review prep. |
| **Agenda** | Unified Today / This-week view combining reminders + due tasks + personal to-dos, plus an "Overdue" bucket. |
| **Analytics** | Local-only dashboard with daily / weekly / monthly / yearly created-vs-completed charts, per-team and per-person scoreboards, plus to-do completion stats. |
| **LAN sync (no cloud)** | Opt-in tiny HTTP server inside Electron with bearer-token auth, **constant-time** token compare, **DNS-rebinding-resistant** Host header validation, **same-LAN-only CORS**, and **payload-shape validation**, so a second device on the same Wi-Fi can pull / push a snapshot — and the host also serves the PWA itself, so an iPhone can open `http://<host-ip>:9787` directly with no mixed-content warning. |
| **Notes (encrypted at rest)** | macOS-Notes-style two-pane view (sidebar list + Markdown editor, pin to top, soft delete with confirm). Locked notes are encrypted with a **workspace master key** derived once per session via **PBKDF2-SHA-256 (200k iters) → AES-256-GCM** (non-extractable `CryptoKey`); every keystroke re-encrypts in sub-millisecond AES with a fresh IV. The passphrase is never written to disk and never stored as a string after derivation — only a tiny verifier blob is persisted. |
| **⌘K Command Palette** | Fuzzy search across navigation, teams, people, items and to-dos with keyboard navigation. |
| **Markdown everywhere** | Notes, scratchpads, item bodies and 1:1 agendas use GitHub-flavored markdown (checklists, tables, code, links). |
| **Recurring reminders** | Daily / weekly / monthly cadence for any reminder, auto-advances after firing. |
| **Smart to-do lists** | List + item drag-and-drop reorder, **priority levels** (Urgent / High / Normal / Low) on both lists and items with sort-by-priority, **hide / show completed**, **delete confirmation**, pin to top, archive, bulk ops, search, count badges. Task input is a multi-line auto-resizing textarea. |
| **Quick scheduling** | Per-task presets (Today 5pm, Tomorrow 9am, +3h, Next Mon 9am) plus a custom datetime picker — no more hunting for an obvious schedule control. |
| **Theming** | Polished light & dark modes with proper input contrast, focus rings, and accent-aware hover states everywhere. |

## Install

### macOS desktop (signed + notarized)

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/sercancelenk/cadence/releases/latest).
2. Download `Cadence-<version>-universal.dmg`. This is a **universal binary** that runs natively on both **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4) and **Intel** Macs — one file for everyone.
3. Open the DMG and drag `Cadence.app` into `Applications`.
4. Launch from Launchpad or Spotlight (⌘ + Space → "Cadence").

Because the DMG is signed with a **Developer ID Application** certificate **and** notarized by Apple, you will not see any "damaged" or "unidentified developer" warning.

### Mobile (PWA on iOS / Android)

1. On your phone, open `https://sercancelenk.github.io/cadence/` in **Safari** (iOS) or **Chrome** (Android).
2. **iOS:** tap the **Share** button → **Add to Home Screen**.
   **Android:** tap **⋮** → **Install app**.
3. Launch from the home-screen icon. The app opens full-screen and jumps straight to the To-dos page.

> **Mobile data is separate by default.** The PWA stores its own data in the phone's `localStorage` (independent of the desktop's encrypted file). To move data between devices use [LAN sync](#lan-sync-multi-device-no-cloud), or *Settings → Backup → Export JSON / Import JSON* as a manual fallback.

### Unsigned local builds

If you build a DMG yourself **without** code signing, macOS quarantines it ("… is damaged"). Bypass once with:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Cadence.app
```

The official Releases DMG never needs this.

---

## Getting started

1. Launch Cadence.
2. Click **Create one** under the sign-in card. Pick an email, display name and a password (8+ chars). The account exists **only on this device**.
3. You land on the Home screen. From there you can:
   - Open the auto-created **My first team**.
   - Create new teams from the *Teams* page.
   - Manage personal lists in *To-dos*.
   - See everything due today/this week in *Agenda*.
4. Press <kbd>⌘ K</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl K</kbd>) anywhere to jump to people, items or pages instantly.

> Tip: install Cadence on a second machine and use *Settings → Backup → Export JSON / Import JSON* to move your data.

- **Account** — local user; password is stored as a salted scrypt hash.
- **Team** — a workspace boundary. Mark teams as Active / Paused / Archived and pin favourites.
- **Me** — your personal space inside a team.
- **My leader** — a dedicated workspace for the relationship with your manager.
- **People** — direct reports / peers; each one has a profile, scratchpad, 1:1 agenda and items.
- **Items** — task, goal, note, **feedback**, document. All can carry markdown body and reminders.
- **To-dos** — personal lists, fully decoupled from teams.

The complete data model is in [`src/model.ts`](./src/model.ts).

---

## Power features

### ⌘K command palette

Press <kbd>⌘ K</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl K</kbd> (Windows / Linux) to open a global fuzzy-search palette:

- **Navigate** — Home, Teams, To-dos, Agenda, Profile, Settings.
- **Teams** — jump straight to any team or its People page.
- **People** — every person across every team.
- **Items** — every task / goal / note / feedback / document by title.
- **To-dos** — every personal task.

Arrow keys to move, <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close.

### Markdown editing

Notes, item bodies, person scratchpads and 1:1 agendas all use **GitHub-flavored markdown** with a Write / Preview toggle:

- Headings, bold/italic, lists, blockquotes, code blocks.
- Checklists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`).
- Tables, autolinks, strikethrough.
- External links open in your default browser.

### Person Timeline

Every person page has a **Timeline** tab that shows a chronological feed of *every* item attached to that person — tasks, goals, notes, feedback, documents — grouped by day (Today / Yesterday / Friday / …) and filterable by kind. Designed for review prep ("what happened with Alice in Q3?").

### 1:1 Mode

Every person also has a **1:1 Mode** tab with two halves:

1. **Current agenda** — a persistent markdown document seeded with sections (Wins / Blockers / Action items / Notes). Use `- [ ]` for action items.
2. **Past meetings** — when you click **Archive meeting**, the current agenda becomes a dated note (`1:1 · 15 May 2026`) attached to that person, and the agenda resets. Any unchecked action items are carried over into the new agenda automatically.

The archived meetings are regular notes, so they also show up in the Person Timeline.

### Agenda

The `/agenda` page is a global, **unified view** of:

- **Overdue** — anything past its due date / reminder still open.
- **Today** — always shown, even when empty.
- **The next 6 days** — only shown when they have entries.

It mixes team-item reminders + due dates with personal to-do dues, marks each entry with its origin team / person, and lets you mark-complete or jump to its workspace inline.

### Analytics dashboard

The `/analytics` page is a fully local, dependency-free dashboard that reads
straight from your workspace data:

- **Stat cards** — total / completed / open / overdue / completion rate.
- **Created vs completed** SVG bar chart with a Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly toggle.
- **Per-team performance** — totals, completed, overdue and a completion-rate progress bar per team.
- **Top contributors** — top 10 people by completed-task count, with their team affiliation.
- **Personal to-dos** — a separate stat block for `/todos` items.

Nothing is sent off-device; the chart is rendered as inline SVG.

### Recurring reminders

Any item reminder can be made **daily / weekly / monthly**. When the reminder fires, the next occurrence is computed and assigned automatically — you never have to recreate weekly 1:1 reminders.

### Feedback log

Every person has a dedicated **Feedback log** alongside Tasks/Goals/Notes/Documents. Each entry is tagged with one of:

- **Praise** (green)
- **Coaching** (blue)
- **Concern** (red)

This makes performance-review prep and growth-conversation prep trivial — open the person's Timeline, filter to Feedback, and you have your talking points.

### Smart to-do lists

The `/todos` page scales as your lists grow:

- **Drag-and-drop reorder, lists and items** — grab the grip handle next to a list title and drop it anywhere; dropping a list across the pinned/unpinned line toggles its pin state automatically. Inside a list, drag individual items by their handle to reorder them.
- **Priorities** — every list and every item has an optional priority chip (Urgent / High / Normal / Low). Use the **Sort** dropdown (Manual / By priority / By due date) to reshape the list on the fly without losing your manual order.
- **Hide / show completed** — toggle at the top of the page; persists per-device so you can keep a clean active view by default.
- **Delete confirmation** — clicking the trash icon arms the row for 3 seconds and turns into a confirm button, so a finger-slip doesn't lose a task.
- **Multi-line task input** — task title is a proper auto-resizing textarea (Enter inserts a newline, ⌘ / Ctrl + Enter submits). Edit an existing task title the same way.
- **Quick scheduling** — every task row has a `Schedule` chip that opens a popover with **Today 5pm**, **Tomorrow 9am**, **+3h**, **Next Mon 9am** presets, plus a custom datetime picker and a one-tap "Clear schedule" action.
- **Pin to top / Archive** — star a list to keep it above the rest, or archive it (toggle "Show archived" to bring them back).
- **Compact / Comfortable toggle** — clearly labelled in the top-right.
- **Mark all complete** / **Clear completed** — bulk operations with confirmations.
- **Search** — filter tasks across all lists in real time.
- **Inline rename** — click the list title to edit.
- **Counts** — every list shows `<open> / <total>` at a glance.

### AI Assistant (BYO API key)

Every task row has an **Ask AI** button as soon as you connect a provider in *Settings → AI Assistant*. The assistant takes the task title + body + your custom system prompt and returns a structured next-action plan, rendered as Markdown in a side dialog.

- **Bring your own key** — pick a provider, paste your API key, optionally override the model name. There is **no proxy**; calls go from this device straight to the provider you chose. The provider sees your task title/body but not your other data.
- **Providers supported**
  - **Anthropic Claude** — default `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`. Suggested: `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`, `claude-3-5-haiku-latest`, `claude-3-opus-latest`.
  - **OpenAI ChatGPT** — default `gpt-4o-mini`. Suggested: `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1-mini`.
  - **Google Gemini** — default `gemini-2.0-flash`. Suggested: `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`. *(Gemini 1.x was retired from `v1beta` in late 2025 and returns HTTP 404; the Settings UI surfaces a one-click fix.)*
- **Test connection** button — sends a one-token round-trip so you can verify the key + model before relying on it during a real task.
- **Follow-up turns** — keep chatting in the dialog (Enter sends, Shift+Enter for newlines). Markdown answers render with headings, lists, code blocks and tables.
- **Append to task** — copy the assistant's answer straight into the task's notes (body) so it sticks around.
- **Extract tasks from notes** — open *To-dos → Extract from notes* and paste a brain dump (meeting transcript, voice-memo, Slack thread, weekend wishlist). The assistant returns a structured list with one imperative task per line and a suggested priority. You edit titles inline, pick which list each task goes into, and click **Add** (per row) or **Add all** to drop them into your workspace. Nothing is added automatically — the user is always the final filter. The prompt is constrained to return strict JSON so the picker stays predictable across providers.
- **Where the key is stored**
  - **Desktop**: inside your encrypted data file (`cadence-data-<userId>.json`, AES-256-GCM, keyed by your account password).
  - **PWA**: in this browser's `localStorage` only (not encrypted) — use a low-budget key with usage limits.

The provider-agnostic transport layer lives in [`src/lib/ai.ts`](./src/lib/ai.ts).

### Backups & recovery

`Settings → Backups & recovery` is your safety net when something goes sideways — for example after a major version upgrade, a password rotation hiccup, or registering a fresh account by mistake.

- **Auto-snapshots** — every save, every successful sign-in and every app launch copies the current `cadence-data-<userId>.json` into `backups/<userId>/data-<label>-<timestamp>.json`. A rolling window of 50 snapshots is kept; oldest are pruned automatically.
- **Refuse-to-overwrite guard** — the data writer refuses to overwrite an existing file when it can't decrypt it with the current session key (instead of silently destroying it). The renderer surfaces this as a red banner pointing at this page.
- **Recovery list** — the page enumerates every candidate source on this machine:
  - **Current data file** (live)
  - **Legacy single-user file** (`leeadman-data.json`, from the pre-accounts era — also picked up by the one-shot rename migration)
  - **Automatic snapshots** (with human-readable "5m ago / 2d ago" times)
  - **Other accounts on this machine** — orphaned `cadence-data-<otherId>.json` files (or pre-rename `leeadman-data-<otherId>.json` files left behind), useful when you registered twice
- Each row shows the file size, modified time, encryption status, and a sniff of what's inside (number of teams, people, items, lists, tasks).
- **Restore** is one click. The current state is itself snapshotted as `pre-restore` first, so the operation is reversible.
- **Auto-migrate on login** — if you log in and your per-user data file doesn't exist yet, but the legacy single-user file (`leeadman-data.json` from pre-accounts builds) does, Cadence imports it into your account automatically. No more "I updated and my old data is gone" surprise.
- **Open data folder** — jumps Finder straight to `~/Library/Application Support/Cadence/` if you want to copy a backup to iCloud / a USB stick.

### Storage & cache

`Settings → Storage & cache` is the honest, read-only picture of what Cadence occupies on this device — plus a safe way to reclaim disk when the browser engine has cached a lot of HTTP responses, V8 code or GPU shaders over months of use.

- **Per-bucket sizes**: encrypted data file, legacy file, your backups, backups belonging to other accounts on the same machine, Chromium-managed caches (HTTP / code / GPU / shader, with a per-folder breakdown), total `userData` size.
- **Clear browser caches** (Electron) — wipes only Chromium-managed caches via the documented `session.clearCache()` / `clearCodeCaches()` / `clearStorageData({ storages: ['cachestorage', 'shadercache'] })` APIs. **Tasks, notes, AI keys, backups and account list are never touched.** Caches repopulate naturally; you may see a one-time slower first request or a shader recompile on next launch.
- **Reload web assets** (PWA) — unregisters the service worker and clears the `caches` API entries on this origin, then hard-reloads. Use this if the PWA feels stuck on an older version; your localStorage (AI key, UI prefs, hashed account credentials) is preserved.

This panel is purely diagnostic — you can ignore it forever and nothing degrades. The auto-prune logic already keeps backups at 50 slots and Chromium self-manages its caches; the buttons exist so you have the option, not as a maintenance chore.

### Notes (encrypted at rest)

`/notes` is a macOS-Notes-style two-pane view for free-form personal notes that don't belong to a team or a person:

- **Sidebar** — chronological list of all notes, with title + one-line preview + last-edited time. Pinned notes float to the top with a star.
- **Editor** — a Markdown editor with edit/preview tabs (same renderer as person scratchpads and 1:1 agendas). Title is a plain inline input; the body autosaves on every keystroke through the same debounced writer your tasks use.
- **Pin / Delete** — pin keeps a note at the top of the list; delete asks for explicit confirmation (locked notes get a louder warning because losing ciphertext is unrecoverable).

**Per-note lock with workspace master key.** Click the lock button on any note and you'll be prompted, once, to set a **Notes passphrase** (≥ 6 chars). From then on:

1. **One-time key derivation.** When you enter the passphrase, Cadence runs **PBKDF2-SHA-256 (200,000 iterations)** against a workspace salt (stored in `AppData.notesLock`) to derive a **256-bit master AES-GCM key**. The key is created with `extractable: false`, so its raw bytes can't be retrieved even from JavaScript — only `encrypt` and `decrypt` calls work.
2. **The passphrase string is discarded.** Only the `CryptoKey` lives in renderer memory for the rest of the session. A memory dump won't yield the passphrase. The pending-input fields in the dialog are cleared as soon as derivation succeeds.
3. **Locking a note** encrypts its body with the cached master key and a **fresh random 12-byte IV per save**. Re-encryption is a single AES-GCM block (sub-millisecond) so we can safely re-encrypt **on every keystroke** while you're editing a locked note — the cipher blob on disk is always current.
4. **Unlocking a note** decrypts the same way. The unlock dialog checks the **verifier blob** first (it tries to decrypt a known constant `"leeadman-notes-v2"`) — so a wrong passphrase is rejected *before* we touch a real note.
5. **Out-of-order encrypt protection.** A monotonic generation counter discards any encrypt result whose keystroke has already been superseded, so two near-simultaneous typings can't cause the older text to overwrite the newer ciphertext.
6. **Session lifetime.** The master key is wiped automatically by logging out, locking the app with PIN, or restarting — the `NotesUnlockProvider` lives below `AuthGate` and unmounts in any of those cases.

**Remove the passphrase.** A *Remove lock* button in the Notes sidebar header opens a confirmation dialog. If accepted, Cadence decrypts every locked note up-front with the current master key; if any note fails (master key mismatch) it aborts the whole operation and leaves your data untouched. On success it converts every locked note back to plaintext and clears `AppData.notesLock` in one atomic save.

**What's stored where:**

| Thing | Plain on disk? |
|---|---|
| Locked note's body | No — only `{ ivB64, cipherB64 }` |
| Locked note's title, pin, timestamps | Yes (intentional — you can still find notes without unlocking) |
| Workspace verifier | Yes (`{ saltB64, verifierIvB64, verifierCipherB64 }`, no key material) |
| Notes passphrase | **Never** |
| Workspace master key | Renderer memory only, non-extractable, dropped on logout/lock/restart |

> **No reset path on purpose.** Because the passphrase is never written down, anyone who steals your data file (including future-you with backups) cannot derive it. If you forget the passphrase your locked notes are unreadable forever. That's the trade we make for honest at-rest encryption; if you want recoverability instead, just don't lock the note.

### Profile & change password

`/profile` is a card-first, view-by-default page:

- **Avatar** — upload any image; it's downscaled to 384 px and stored as a JPEG `data:` URL on your profile, so it shows up in the top-bar avatar everywhere.
- **View mode** — name, role, department, phone, email and bio rendered as a read-only grid; an **Edit** button (top-right) flips the same card into form mode with a Save / Cancel pair.
- **Change password** — a secondary tab that asks for **Current password**, **New password** and **Confirm**. On Electron the new password is also used to **re-encrypt your data file** in a single atomic swap; the old key is wiped from memory immediately.

### LAN sync (multi-device, no cloud)

`Settings → Multi-device sync` lets two devices on the same Wi-Fi share a workspace without any cloud service:

- The Electron app runs an optional, opt-in HTTP server (default port `9787`) protected by a **bearer token** stored in `sync.json`.
- Endpoints:
  - `GET  /v1/ping` — **unauthenticated** reachability probe; clients hit this to distinguish "host unreachable" from "host reachable but wrong token".
  - `GET  /v1/snapshot` — returns the active user's data (Bearer token required).
  - `POST /v1/snapshot` — replaces the active user's data (Bearer token required).
  - `GET  /*` — serves the **bundled PWA assets** (index.html, JS, CSS, icons) from the host's own `dist/` folder. This is what defeats the "https://github.io → http://lan" mixed-content block, see below.
- Settings shows the host's reachable LAN URLs, the pairing token (with a Rotate button) and a **Pair with another device** form for the *client* side: paste the URL + token and tap **Pull from host** or **Push to host**.
- The server auto-resumes on next launch if you previously enabled it.

**Mobile / PWA pairing — the mixed-content fix:** browsers block plain-HTTP fetches from HTTPS pages, so calling `http://192.168.1.5:9787` from `https://*.github.io` is silently denied — that's the "Pull failed" you'd otherwise see. Cadence dodges this by serving the **same PWA bundle** from the sync server. The host UI shows a `http://<lan-ip>:9787/` URL labelled *For mobile or PWA on this network — open this URL in the browser*; opening it on your phone loads the Cadence PWA over plain HTTP from the host, so the subsequent `fetch('http://.../v1/snapshot')` is **same-origin** and the browser permits it. No more github.io ↔ LAN dead-end.

**Client UX**: the pair form normalises whatever you type (adds `http://`, defaults port `9787`), has a **Test reachability** button that pings `/v1/ping` with an 8-second timeout, and gives targeted error messages — `401` ("token rotated/wrong"), `503` ("no user signed in on the host"), timeout ("check Wi-Fi and that the host server is running") instead of a generic "Pull failed".

#### Sync security — what we did and didn't do

The threat model is "untrusted devices on the same Wi-Fi" and "a malicious public website trying to reach into the user's LAN through their browser". Defenses, in code:

- **Random 192-bit token.** `crypto.randomBytes(24)` per workspace, base64-encoded. Brute-force is not on the table.
- **Constant-time token compare.** `crypto.timingSafeEqual` instead of `===`, plus a small artificial delay on failure paths so 401 vs 200 cannot be cleanly differentiated by latency measurement.
- **DNS-rebinding defense.** Every request's `Host:` header is checked against a private-IP / localhost / `.local` allow-list. A browser that's been tricked into thinking `attacker.com` resolves to your LAN IP still sends `Host: attacker.com` — we send back 403 before any route runs.
- **CORS without wildcards.** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is never returned. We echo the request `Origin` only when it parses to a private-IP / localhost / `.local` hostname, otherwise no CORS header is set — so a malicious public web origin can't pivot through the user's browser even if it had the token.
- **Payload shape validation.** `POST /v1/snapshot` rejects bodies that don't have the required `AppData` discriminators (`version`, `teams`, `people`, `items`, `todoGroups`, `todoItems`) with a 422 before writing.
- **Minimal `/v1/ping`.** Returns `{ ok: true, name: 'leeadman-sync' }` only — no version, no session indicator, no fingerprintable metadata.
- **Body size cap.** `POST` bodies over 25 MB get an explicit `413 Payload Too Large` response (with a JSON error body) before we keep buffering, instead of a bare socket reset that the client would render as a useless "Pull failed".
- **Refuse-to-overwrite + auto-backup.** Even if a properly-authenticated client pushes a corrupt-but-shape-valid payload, the writer takes a snapshot before saving and refuses to save an undecipherable file. Worst case: one round-trip to the **Backups & recovery** tab.

#### Why we don't (yet) run HTTPS

Self-signed HTTPS is technically easy (Node `https.createServer` + a generated cert) but **counter-productive** for a LAN tool:

- iOS Safari and Chrome show a *Not secure* warning on every visit; the user habituates to clicking "Proceed anyway", which trains them to ignore the very warning that protects against real attacks.
- Real CA certificates require a public DNS name and ports 80/443 reachable from the internet — which is exactly what a LAN-only tool is trying to *avoid*.
- The mixed-content block that motivated HTTPS in the first place is already solved by the host serving its own PWA bundle (see *the mixed-content fix*).

Net: on a trusted home network, HTTP-on-LAN + the hardening above is more honest than HTTPS-with-a-warning-everyone-clicks-through. If your threat model includes an untrusted Wi-Fi network (a coffee shop, a hotel) — don't run the sync server there at all; the toggle is off by default for a reason.

## Mobile / PWA

Cadence ships as a **Progressive Web App** in addition to the desktop Electron build. The same React bundle is deployed to GitHub Pages and installable on iOS/Android.

### Setup (repository owner — one-time)

1. **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**.
2. Push to `main`. The [`pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml) workflow runs, builds with `CADENCE_PWA=1`, and publishes to `https://<user>.github.io/cadence/`.

### Install on your phone

1. Open the URL above in Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android).
2. **Share → Add to Home Screen** / **⋮ → Install app**.
3. The app installs with its own icon and launches full-screen, going straight to the To-dos page.

### What works offline

- The app shell (HTML / CSS / JS / icons) is cached on first visit.
- All your data lives in the phone's `localStorage`, so reads and edits work fully offline.
- New deploys are picked up silently the next time the device is online (service worker uses *network-first* for navigation, *stale-while-revalidate* for hashed assets).

### Building the PWA locally

```bash
# Regenerate icons after editing public/icon.svg
npm run icons

# Build for GitHub Pages (sets base path to /cadence/)
npm run build:pwa
```

### Mobile-specific UX

- **Slide-in drawer sidebar** — on screens ≤700 px the sidebar starts hidden so the content gets the full viewport. Tap the hamburger to slide it in over a backdrop; tap any link or the backdrop to dismiss. Body scroll is locked while the drawer is open.
- **No iOS auto-zoom** — every input/select/textarea renders at ≥16 px on phones, so Safari doesn't zoom in on focus.
- **Full-screen command palette** on mobile.
- **Single-column to-do row layout** with 40 px touch targets and a wrapped section header.
- **Launching from the home-screen shortcut** auto-redirects `/` → `/todos`.
- **iOS safe-area** padding is honoured (status bar / home indicator).

### Files added for PWA support

```

  manifest.webmanifest      # PWA metadata

```

---

## Keyboard & native menus

Cadence ships with a native menu bar (English):

- **Cadence** — About, Check for Updates…, Quit
- **File** — Close window / Quit
- **Edit** — Undo / Redo / Cut / Copy / Paste / Select All
- **View** — Reload, Zoom, Toggle Full Screen
- **Window** — Minimize, Zoom
- **Help** — Project on GitHub, Report an Issue

Standard shortcuts apply (⌘ Q, ⌘ W, ⌘ R, ⌘ F, ⌘ , …). The global **⌘ K** opens the command palette from anywhere.

---

## Data, privacy and backups

- **Where data lives** (macOS): `~/Library/Application Support/Cadence/`. (Pre-rename installs originally wrote to `~/Library/Application Support/Leeadman/`; that folder is consumed and converted on first launch — see [Dev vs installed app data isolation](#dev-vs-installed-app-data-isolation).)
  - `cadence-accounts.json` — user list (email, salted **scrypt** password hash, per-user `encSalt`).
  - `cadence-session.json` — id of the signed-in user.
  - `cadence-data-<userId>.json` — your workspace data, per account, **encrypted at rest** (AI key, tasks, lists, people, notes, preferences — everything).
  - `leeadman-data.json` — legacy single-user file from pre-accounts versions (only present if you upgraded from an old install). Auto-imported on first login.
  - `backups/<userId>/data-<label>-<timestamp>.json` — rolling auto-snapshots (50 slots; labels include `launch`, `post-login`, `pre-save`, `pre-pwchange`, `pre-restore`).
  - `auth-lock.json` — optional PIN hash.
  - `sync.json` — LAN sync server config (token + enabled flag) when sync is on.
- **Encryption-at-rest** (Electron): your data file is wrapped in **AES-256-GCM**. The 256-bit key is derived from your password with `scrypt(password, encSalt)` at login and lives only in main-process memory until logout. Changing your password atomically decrypts with the old key, derives a fresh `encSalt`, and re-encrypts under the new key. Legacy plaintext files from older versions are upgraded silently on the first save after login.
- **Refuse-to-overwrite guard**: when the data writer finds an existing file it can't decrypt with the in-memory key, it refuses to write — your data stays safe and the UI surfaces a banner pointing at *Settings → Backups & recovery*.
- **PIN protection** is an additional launch-time UI barrier (not the encryption key). It can be enabled/disabled independently in Settings. If you forget it, the lock screen has a "Forgot PIN? Reset with account password" flow (rate-limited).
- **Mobile PWA**: data lives in the browser's `localStorage` for the Pages origin and is **not** encrypted by the app — rely on the device's keychain / disk encryption.
- **No telemetry, no analytics.** Sync only happens when you explicitly use the LAN server (or Export/Import).
- **Backups**: see [**Backups & recovery**](#backups--recovery). For manual portable backups use *Settings → Backup → Export JSON*; the export is the **decrypted** data so you can diff / migrate it. Treat it like a sensitive file. Use *Import JSON* to restore — it replaces your current data (and snapshots the old state first).

---

## Auto-updates

The packaged desktop app checks GitHub Releases on launch via [`electron-updater`](https://www.electron.build/auto-update):

1. Reads `latest-mac.yml` from the latest release.
2. If the published version is higher than the installed one, downloads the new build in the background.
3. Shows an OS notification when the download is ready ("Update available — restart to install"). Quit and relaunch to apply.

You can also force an interactive check from *Settings → Auto updates → Check for updates*. A dialog walks you through the full flow:

- *Checking…* spinner.
- If you're current: *"You're on the latest version (vX.Y.Z)."* with an OK button.
- If a newer release exists: progress bar with percent and MB transferred.
- When the download finishes: an *Install & restart* button — clicking it runs `quitAndInstall` so the app closes, swaps in the new binary, and relaunches without you having to manually quit. *Later* defers the install until next launch.
- Errors are surfaced inline with the message from `electron-updater`.

You can also trigger the same check from the menu bar via *Cadence → Check for Updates…*. Development builds (`npm run dev`) short-circuit the check and the dialog shows a "disabled in development mode" notice.

The PWA "updates" itself silently via the service worker — the next time the device is online and you reopen the app, the new build is fetched and applied on the following navigation. Bumping `CACHE_VERSION` in `public/sw.js` invalidates every old cache.

---

## Building from source

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- macOS 12+ (only for producing a macOS DMG)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sercancelenk/cadence.git
cd leeadman
npm install
```

### Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts Vite at `http://localhost:5173` and launches Electron pointed at it with hot reload. Runs in an **isolated `userData` directory** (`~/Library/Application Support/Cadence (Dev)/` on macOS), so a dev session can never read, write or corrupt the data of the installed app — see [Dev vs installed app data isolation](#dev-vs-installed-app-data-isolation). |
| `npm run build:web` | Builds the Electron-targeted React bundle (`base: ./`) into `dist/`. |
| `npm run build:pwa` | Builds the GitHub-Pages-targeted PWA bundle (`base: /cadence/`) into `dist/`. |
| `npm run build` | `build:web` + `electron-builder` (local desktop bundle). |
| `npm run build:release` | `build:web` + `electron-builder --publish always` (used by the release workflow). |
| `npm run icons` | Regenerates PWA icons from `public/icon.svg` (uses `sharp`). |
| `npm run preview` | Vite preview server for the last build. |

### Local DMG without Apple credentials

```bash
CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false npm run build
```

### Dev vs installed app data isolation

If you've already installed Cadence from a DMG **and** you want to run the
local checkout side-by-side to try out new features, the two builds could
otherwise share the same on-disk data — Electron derives `userData` from
`app.getName()`, and macOS APFS is case-insensitive, so two builds with
the same display name resolve to the same directory. Running a dev build
on prod data is risky because a dev build typically writes a newer
on-disk schema than the installed version understands, which can silently
strip new fields on the next save.

To prevent this, `electron/main.cjs` detects dev mode (the
`VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL` env var that `npm run dev` sets) and routes everything
through a separate folder:

| Build | macOS `userData` |
|---|---|
| Installed DMG (production) | `~/Library/Application Support/Cadence/` |
| `npm run dev` | `~/Library/Application Support/Cadence (Dev)/` |

#### One-shot migration from the pre-rename name

This project used to be called *Leeadman*. The very first launch after the
rename detects a `~/Library/Application Support/Leeadman/` (or `Leeadman
(Dev)/` for dev) folder, copies its contents into the new `Cadence/` (or
`Cadence (Dev)/`) folder, and **renames every `leeadman-*.json` to
`cadence-*.json` on the way**. The legacy folder is left in place untouched
as a safety net — feel free to delete it manually once you've confirmed
your data made it across. The migration is guarded by the presence of
`cadence-accounts.json` in the new folder, so it never runs twice and
never overwrites a workspace you've already started using under the new
name.

Side effects you should know about:

- A brand-new dev session starts with **no accounts, no tasks, no notes** —
  you'll see the same "register an account" screen as a brand-new user.
- The single-instance lock keys off `app.getName()` too, so the installed
  app and a dev session can **run at the same time**. They'll appear as two
  separate apps in the Dock; both windows are functional.
- Auto-update is already gated by `app.isPackaged`, so the dev session
  never tries to update itself.
- To **test on a copy of your real data**, quit the installed app first
  (it writes on quit), then copy the file you care about:
  ```bash
  cp -R "~/Library/Application Support/Cadence/"* \
        "~/Library/Application Support/Cadence (Dev)/"
  ```
  This includes accounts, encrypted data files, backups and sync config.
  The dev session opens the next time you `npm run dev`.

## Releasing

Both the desktop release and the PWA deploy are **manual**, and **nothing
runs automatically on push or pull request**. To publish, open the *Actions*
tab and pick the workflow you want; CI runs first as a gate inside it.

### Workflows at a glance

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) | reusable (`workflow_call`) + manual (`Run workflow`) | `tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build:web`. Invoked as the green-light gate by Release & Pages; you can also fire it on demand to sanity-check a branch. |
| [`pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml) | manual (`Run workflow`) | Calls CI → `npm run build:pwa` → publishes to GitHub Pages. |
| [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) | manual (`Run workflow`) | Calls CI → bumps version to `0.2.<run_number>` → `electron-builder --publish always` → signs + notarizes the `.app` → uploads DMG/ZIP/`latest-mac.yml` to a new GitHub Release. |

### Cutting a desktop release

1. **Actions** tab → **Release** → **Run workflow** (on `main`).
2. The reusable CI job runs first; if it goes red the macOS job is skipped, no DMG built, no Apple minutes burned.
3. On green, the macOS runner signs + notarizes + publishes. Once the release shows up on GitHub, every installed Cadence picks it up via [`electron-updater`](#auto-updates).

### Updating the mobile PWA

1. **Actions** tab → **Deploy PWA to GitHub Pages** → **Run workflow**.
2. Same CI gate, then the PWA bundle is rebuilt and Pages is updated. The service worker `CACHE_VERSION` invalidation makes existing installs pull the new shell on next visit.

Required repository permissions: **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions = Read and write**.

---

## macOS code signing & notarization

For DMGs to open without the "… is damaged and can't be opened" Gatekeeper error on someone else's Mac, the build **must** be:

1. Signed with a **Developer ID Application** certificate from a paid Apple Developer Program account, and
2. Notarized by Apple's `notarytool` service.

This repo's release workflow does both automatically. You only need to set up the secrets once.

### 1. Create a Developer ID Application certificate

1. In **Keychain Access**, open *Certificate Assistant → Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority…*. Save the CSR to disk.
2. In [developer.apple.com → Certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list), click **+**, choose **Developer ID Application** under *Software*, then *G2 Sub-CA (Xcode 11.4.1 or later)*.
3. Upload the CSR, download the resulting `.cer`, and double-click to install it into the **login** keychain.
4. In *Keychain Access → My Certificates*, verify that "Developer ID Application: \<Your Name\> (\<TEAM\_ID\>)" appears with a private key under it.

### 2. Export the certificate as `.p12`

1. Right-click the certificate → **Export…** → format **Personal Information Exchange (.p12)**.
2. Set a strong export password (this becomes `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` below).
3. Save as `developer-id.p12`.

### 3. Create an App-Specific Password

1. Go to <https://appleid.apple.com>.
2. *Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords → +*.
3. Save the generated `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` password.

### 4. Add GitHub repository secrets

In **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add:

| Secret name                   | Value                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CSC_LINK`                    | base64 of `developer-id.p12` — `base64 -i developer-id.p12 \| pbcopy` |
| `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`            | `.p12` export password                                                |
| `APPLE_ID`                    | Apple Developer account email                                         |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | the `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` password                                    |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`               | 10-character Team ID (e.g. `ME5ER9CA9Q`)                              |

The Team ID is also configured in `package.json` under `build.mac.notarize.teamId` — update it there if you fork this project.

### 5. Verify locally

After installing a signed build:

```bash
codesign -dv --verbose=4 /Applications/Cadence.app
spctl -a -t exec -vv /Applications/Cadence.app
xcrun stapler validate /Applications/Cadence.app
```

`spctl` should respond with `accepted source=Notarized Developer ID`. If it does, every user can install your DMG without any warning.

### Entitlements

The signed binary uses the entitlements at [`build/entitlements.mac.plist`](./build/entitlements.mac.plist):

- `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` — required by V8 in Electron.
- `com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory` — JIT support.
- `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` — load Electron framework dylibs.
- `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` — used by Electron's bootstrap.
- `com.apple.security.network.client` / `server` — outbound update checks and IPC.

## Electron deep dive

If you want to go beyond "build it and ship it" and actually understand how
the desktop side of Cadence works under the hood, there's a dedicated guide
that doubles as a hands-on Electron tutorial:

> **[docs/electron-guide.md](docs/electron-guide.md)** — a practical Electron
> tutorial walking through this codebase: the two-process model, the preload
> bridge, IPC patterns, the security checklist, AES-256-GCM encryption at
> rest, the auto-update flow, the LAN sync HTTP server, the build pipeline,
> debugging tips and the most common pitfalls.

It's written so a developer who has never touched Electron can read it
top-to-bottom and end up confidently extending `electron/main.cjs` and
`electron/preload.cjs`.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS says "Cadence.app is damaged and can't be opened"</strong></summary>

For official releases this should not happen — they are signed + notarized. If it does, the file was likely tampered with in transit; download again from the [releases page](https://github.com/sercancelenk/cadence/releases). For DIY (unsigned) builds, run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Cadence.app
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The app opens but the window is blank</strong></summary>

That usually means the renderer crashed before painting. The ErrorBoundary should display the stack trace; please file an issue with that text. In development you can open DevTools with <kbd>⌘ ⌥ I</kbd>.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Update check failed: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED"</strong></summary>

You're offline or behind a captive portal. Auto-update will retry on next launch; nothing to fix.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The PWA shows a stale build after I deployed a new one</strong></summary>

The service worker uses network-first for navigation, so a second visit when online should fetch the new shell. If you want to force-refresh: from the installed PWA, pull-to-refresh or close-and-reopen the app. From a browser, hard-refresh and clear site data once.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I forgot my account password</strong></summary>

Passwords are not recoverable (they're stored as salted scrypt hashes locally). You can edit `cadence-accounts.json` in `~/Library/Application Support/Cadence/` and remove the user entry, then sign up again. Your workspace JSON file is named `cadence-data-<userId>.json` — keep it if you want to import it into the new account.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I forgot my PIN</strong></summary>

The lock screen has a *Forgot PIN? Reset with account password* link. It asks for your account password (the one you sign in with), rate-limits attempts, and on success clears the PIN so you can set a new one. No terminal commands required.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I updated and my data looks empty / I see a "refusing to overwrite" banner</strong></summary>

Don't panic — your data is still on disk. Open *Settings → Backups & recovery*. The page lists every candidate source: the current file, the legacy single-user file (`leeadman-data.json`, from pre-accounts builds), every automatic snapshot (50 rolling slots labelled `launch` / `post-login` / `pre-save` / `pre-pwchange` / `pre-restore`), and any orphaned per-user file from a previous account UUID. Pick the one with the right item counts → **Restore**. The current state is itself snapshotted as `pre-restore` first, so the operation is reversible.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Gemini Test connection returns HTTP 404 with "model not found"</strong></summary>

Google retired the Gemini 1.x family from the `v1beta` endpoint in late 2025. Open *Settings → AI Assistant*, click the inline **gemini-2.0-flash** suggestion (or any other current model from the list), Save, then run **Test connection** again. The current GA defaults are `gemini-2.0-flash` and `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`; `gemini-2.5-flash` / `gemini-2.5-pro` are higher quality but rate-limited on the free tier.

</details>

### Tier 2 — next

| # | Feature | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Cycle / Quarter scope for goals + progress % | OKR support: parent/child (Objective → Key Result), quarter tagging, progress with history. |
| 2.2 | Templates (1:1, skip-level, perf review, onboarding) | Apply a template to a new note/meeting and get a structured outline instantly. |
| 2.3 | Person attributes | Start date, timezone, location, level, manager (dotted-line), pronouns, skills. Auto-computed tenure. |
| 2.4 | iCal (`.ics`) export | Read-only feed so macOS Calendar / Google Calendar can subscribe. |
| 2.5 | HTTPS for LAN sync (self-signed) | Lets the GitHub Pages PWA pull from the desktop without mixed-content blocking. |
| 2.6 | Field-level merge in sync (last-write-wins per item) | Today's `Pull` / `Push` replace the whole snapshot; per-item merge would let two devices edit in parallel. |
| 2.7 | QR-code rendering of the LAN pairing URL+token | Faster pairing on phones — point camera, no typing. |
